# Prompt: 影视级分镜拆解与动力学配方 (Shot Recipe Extraction)

**Role**: You are a Master Cinematographer, Storyboard Artist, and VFX Supervisor with expertise in AI-driven video generation pipelines.

**Task**: Perform a frame-by-frame technical decomposition of the provided video. Extract a "Technical Skeleton" that enables an AI pipeline (Imagen 4.0 → Veo 3.1) to replicate the cinematography while allowing for narrative remixing.

**Output Layers**:
- **Concrete**: Specific technical parameters with exact values (for direct T2I/I2V prompt generation)
- **Abstract**: Narrative functions and reusable templates (for remixing with new subjects)

---

## 1. SHOT SPLITTING RULES (Strictly Follow)

### Boundaries
- **Cut Detection**: Identify exact timestamps where visual cuts occur
- **Camera Continuity**: Do NOT split continuous camera movements (pan/tilt/dolly/zoom) unless there is a literal cut
- **Scene Changes**: New location or significant time jump = new shot

### Duration Constraints
- **Minimum**: ≥1.0 second (merge micro-cuts into logical units)
- **Maximum**: No hard limit, but shots >5.0 seconds MUST include `"longTake": true` flag
- **Target Density**: For a 60-second video, aim for 15-25 shots

### Quantity Limit
- **Maximum 30 shots** per video
- If raw cut count exceeds 30, merge adjacent shots that share:
  - Same subject focus
  - Same narrative beat
  - Similar camera language
- Prioritize preserving: HOOK, CATALYST, CLIMAX, RESOLUTION beats

### Precision Requirement
- Sum of all `durationSeconds` MUST equal total video length
- Timestamps in format: `"HH:MM:SS.mmm"` (e.g., `"00:00:02.500"`)

## 3. EXTRACTION GUIDELINES (Imagen 4.0 + Veo 3.1 Alignment)

### First Frame (Imagen 4.0 Critical)
- `firstFrameDescription` is the MOST IMPORTANT field
- Describe as if directing a photographer for a single still image
- Include: exact pose, facial micro-expression, gaze vector, hand positions, clothing state, prop positions
- Precision here determines video stability in Veo 3.1

### Motion & Gaze (Veo 3.1 Critical)
- In `subject`, describe the MOTION ARC from first frame to last frame of the shot
- Eye contact changes are especially important (e.g., "shifts gaze from 45° left to direct lens contact")
- Specify motion speed: "slowly", "suddenly", "gradually"

### Dialogue & Lip-Sync
- If dialogue exists, `dialogueText` MUST contain exact transcription
- Note emotional delivery in `audio.dialogue` (e.g., "whispered, trembling", "confident, measured")
- For non-dialogue shots, set `dialogueText` to empty string `""`

### Dynamics (Physics Simulation)
- Identify ALL secondary motions: hair, fabric, particles, liquids, smoke, reflections
- Veo 3.1 needs explicit physics cues for realistic animation
- Include environmental dynamics: background movement, light flicker, weather effects

### Negative Prompts (Quality Assurance)
- ALWAYS include baseline artifacts: `"blurry, extra limbs, malformed hands, text, watermark"`
- Add shot-specific exclusions based on content (e.g., for close-up: `"visible pores exaggerated, skin smoothing"`)
- For stylized content, exclude conflicting styles (e.g., `"photorealistic"` for animation)

### Watermark & Overlay Detection (CRITICAL)
- Carefully inspect EVERY shot for watermarks, logos, social media UI overlays (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube), usernames, timestamps, or any non-diegetic text/graphics
- Set `watermarkInfo.hasWatermark` to `true` if ANY overlay is detected, `false` otherwise
- In `watermarkInfo.description`, specify the type and position (e.g., "TikTok logo top-right corner, username '@creator' bottom-left")
- Set `watermarkInfo.occludesSubject` to `true` if the watermark covers any part of a character's face or body
- In `watermarkInfo.occludedArea`, describe what part of the subject is obscured (e.g., "partially covers subject's right cheek") or "none" if no occlusion
- Do NOT describe watermark artifacts as character features in `firstFrameDescription` or `subject` fields — always describe the character's TRUE appearance beneath any overlays

## 4. BEAT TAGGING REFERENCE

| Beat Tag | Narrative Function | Typical Position |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| HOOK | Capture attention, establish intrigue | 0-10% |
| SETUP | Establish world, characters, status quo | 5-25% |
| CATALYST | Inciting incident, disruption | 20-30% |
| RISING | Escalating tension, complications | 30-50% |
| TURN | Major reversal, midpoint shift | 45-55% |
| CLIMAX | Peak conflict, maximum tension | 70-85% |
| FALLING | Consequences unfold | 80-90% |
| RESOLUTION | New equilibrium, closure | 85-100% |

---

## 5. CINEMATOGRAPHY REFERENCE GUIDE

### Shot Types (shotSize field)
Select based on emotional intent and scene requirements:

| Code | Name | Description | Best Used For |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| ELS | Extreme Long Shot | Characters tiny like ants, environment dominates | Opening establishing shots, expressing isolation/loneliness |
| LS | Long Shot | Characters small but actions clearly visible | Action scenes, environment showcase, character introduction |
| MLS | Medium Long Shot | Full body visible, some environment context | Walking scenes, group interactions |
| MS | Medium Shot | Waist and up | Standard dialogue, balance of action and expression |
| MCU | Medium Close-up | Chest and up | Emotional exchange, reaction shots, interviews |
| CU | Close-up | Face/head only | Emphasize emotion, important lines, intimate moments |
| ECU | Extreme Close-up | Partial details (eyes, hands, objects) | Create tension, imply clues, dramatic emphasis |
| POV | Point of View | From character's perspective | Subjective experience, horror, discovery moments |
| OTS | Over the Shoulder | From behind one character's shoulder | Dialogue scenes, establish spatial relationships |

### Camera Angles (cameraAngle field)
Select based on power dynamics and psychological intent:

| Angle | Description | Psychological Effect |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| Eye-level | Same height as character's eyes | Build empathy, neutral/realistic feel |
| High-angle | Camera shoots down from above | Express vulnerability, helplessness, oppression |
| Low-angle | Camera shoots up from below | Elevate hero/power, create fear/intimidation |
| Dutch | Camera tilted off horizontal axis | Mental disturbance, unease, suspense atmosphere |
| Bird's-eye | 90° vertical down (directly overhead) | Establish geography, visual spectacle, godlike perspective |
| Worm's-eye | Extreme low angle from ground | Dramatic power, architectural grandeur |

### Camera Movements (cameraMovement field)
Select based on narrative pacing and subject motion:

| Movement | Description | Best Used For |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Static | Camera completely stationary | Build tension, comedy timing, contemplative moments |
| Pan L/R | Camera rotates horizontally left or right | Scan scene, follow horizontal movement, reveal |
| Tilt U/D | Camera rotates vertically up or down | Reveal height, show power dynamics, dramatic reveal |
| Dolly In/Out | Camera physically moves toward/away from subject | Enhance emotional impact, change intimacy level |
| Track L/R | Camera moves horizontally parallel to subject | Follow walking characters, showcase environment |
| Truck | Horizontal lateral movement on rails | Smooth parallel tracking, professional polish |
| Crane/Boom | Vertical lift or drop movement | Scene transitions, emphasize importance, epic scale |
| Zoom | Optical focal length change (no physical movement) | Quick emphasis, artificial/stylized feel, detail punch |
| Handheld | Operator-held camera with natural shake | Documentary realism, urgency, chaos |
| Steadicam | Stabilized handheld for smooth floating motion | Following characters through spaces, dreamlike quality |
| Arc/Orbit | Camera rotates around the subject | 360° character showcase, dramatic reveal, hero moment |
| Following | Camera trails behind character | Chase scenes, journey emphasis |
| Leading | Camera moves in front of character facing back | Guide viewer, anticipation building |
| Slider | Small rail for subtle smooth lateral movement | Subtle dynamism, interview polish, detail showcase |

### Selection Decision Tree
1. **What's the emotional intent?** → Choose Shot Type
2. **What's the power dynamic?** → Choose Camera Angle
3. **Is there subject motion?** → Choose Camera Movement accordingly
4. **What's the pacing?** → Static for slow/tense, Dynamic for action/energy

## 6. DATA INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS

- Output **ONLY pure JSON**. No markdown code blocks, no explanatory text.
- Every field in the schema **MUST** be present for every shot.
- If a technical value cannot be determined (e.g., exact focal length), provide a **"Cinematic Inference"** based on visual analysis (e.g., "Estimated 50mm based on compression and DOF").
- `dialogueText` must be empty string `""` if no dialogue, never `null` or omitted.
- `longTake` boolean is REQUIRED for all shots.

SHOT_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
# Prompt: Lightweight Shot Detection (Phase 1)

**Role**: Video Editor performing shot boundary detection.

**Task**: Identify all shot boundaries in the video and extract basic metadata ONLY.
Do NOT provide detailed descriptions - those will be extracted in Phase 2.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CALIBRATION WARNING ⚠️
Internal testing shows your timestamp detection for scene cuts is consistently **1.0-1.5 seconds EARLIER** than the actual visual change.
To compensate: When outputting `representativeTimestamp`, you MUST manually **ADD 1.0 seconds** to your initial visual estimate to ensure the captured frame belongs to the CORRECT shot.

## Output Requirements
- **CRITICAL**: Keep JSON compact. Only include fields specified below.
- Maximum 30 shots per video
- If cuts exceed 30, merge adjacent shots sharing same subject/scene

## Representative Timestamp (CRITICAL - READ CAREFULLY)
For each shot, you MUST provide a `representativeTimestamp` (in seconds as a decimal number).

This must be the exact second where the new scene is **100% VISUALLY ESTABLISHED**.

**RULES:**
1. **DO NOT pick a point near the start boundary**. If you detect a cut at 1.4s but the previous scene is still fading out, you MUST pick a timestamp at least 1.0s AFTER your detected start time.
2. **Look for "Peak Stability"**: The moment where the subject is fully in frame and motion blur is minimal.
3. **FOR SHORT SHOTS (duration < 2 seconds)**: Set `representativeTimestamp` to exactly `endTime - 0.2`. This is the ONLY way to ensure the scene transition has completed for fast-cut videos.
4. **FOR NORMAL SHOTS (duration >= 2 seconds)**: Pick a timestamp in the 70-90% range of the shot duration.

Example: If you describe "A choir singing" for a shot from 3.14s to 4.27s (duration 1.13s < 2s), use `representativeTimestamp: 4.07` (which is endTime - 0.2)
